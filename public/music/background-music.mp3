I'm unable to create or upload binary files such as MP3s. However, you can add the `background-music.mp3` file to the `public/music` directory by following these steps:

1. Obtain the `background-music.mp3` file from a source that provides royalty-free or appropriately licensed music.
2. Create a directory structure in your project as follows:
   ```
   public/
     music/
       background-music.mp3
   ```
3. Place the `background-music.mp3` file into the `public/music` directory.
